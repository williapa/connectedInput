# connectedInput
slider and formatted text input living together in harmony!

Example relies on html attributes and javascript. The CSS is minimal and does not provide any functionality.
In general, this should be a good template to show how to create a reusable connected Input for your own project.

## html description: 

Connected input marries a slider with a validated text input, formatted for currency use. 
Value for both fields is always identical, one text formatted and one plain value. 
A minimum and maximum can easily be set in html. 
Javascript ensures $ and comma are always displayed. 
Text field is validated on blur. 
Text field input gradient can be toggled.
Best of all? No need for dumb, tacky validation errors!
